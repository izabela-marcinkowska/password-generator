# password-generator
This is my project for a password generator. You will have two sorts of passwords to choose from. 

## Random password 
Random way will generate a password in random order, always starting with a letter. You will have to input:
##### Amount letters 
You can choose between 8 to 25 letters. If you leave this choice empty password will generate 10 characters.

##### Letters
If you choose letters option password will include random capitals and lowercase letters. You cannot choose only capitals or only lowercase. 

##### Numbers
If you choose numbers option random numbers between 0 and 9 will be randomly added to the password. 

##### Special signs 
If you choose special signs option you will get all allowed ASCII signs added to the password. To match the rules of the most sites, we will not start password with a special sign. 

## Dash-separated password 
You will have option to choose password written with the dash-separted way. It means that password will include letters, numbers and signs and they will evanly separated by dashes.
